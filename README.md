[Integralist](http://www.integralist.co.uk/) - isMouseOver
================================

Description
-----------

Looking into a better way to show/hide elements (modals/dialogs) within the context of a complicated web app where standard mouseover/out causes lots of extra code for instances where child elements of a container cause the mouseout/over to trigger at the wrong time (something thmouseenter/leave events were designed to avoid).

I'm putting this code online so it's easily accessible to others, but the credit goes to: [Michael Dean](http://www.michaeld.co.uk/) who came up with the initial concept and the isMouseOver.js script
