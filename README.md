[Integralist](http://www.integralist.co.uk/) - isMouseOver
================================

Description
-----------

Looking into a better way to show/hide elements (modals/dialogs) within the context of a complicated web app where standard mouseover/out causes lots of extra code for instances where child elements of a container cause the mouseout/over to trigger at the wrong time (something thmouseenter/leave events were designed to avoid).
